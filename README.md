# MyProject: Cross road game (day 23)
How the game works:

1. Press the button Up in the keyboard to move the turtle to the top of the screen. That's the only way to move the turtle.
2. If a car hits the body of the turtle you will lose, but if it hits only the head you won't.
3. When you reach the end of the road, you will get back to the starting position, and the level will increase by 1.
4. When the level increases, one more car will be add, and the speed will increase as well
   untill you reach level 10 the speed will stop increaseing and only cars will be added.
